Of course, OpenSpending is an `open source <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html>`_ 
project and we aim to include contributions into production as quickly 
as possible. 

We work as a distributed team and most discussions take place either on the
`openspending-dev <http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending-dev>`_
mailing list or on IRC (``#openspending`` on FreeNode).

If you feel like hacking core, check out the 
`GitHub issues <https://github.com/okfn/openspending>`_ to see what is 
going on and where help is needed.
