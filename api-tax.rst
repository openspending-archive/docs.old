Tax share API
=============

The tax share API estimates a household's tax contribution based on simple 
proxy data. The estimate allows for both direct tax (including income tax, 
national insurance and council tax) and indirect tax (including VAT, alcohol 
and tobacco duty, and fuel duty).

.. code-block:: rest

  GET http://openspending.org/api/mytax?income=N

The basic call accepts a variety of parameters, most of which are optional:

``income`` (required)
  Total household income, including all pension and benefits. This is 
  used to estimate total tax paid, including both direct and indirect 
  taxation.

``spending`` 
  Total spending on consumption.

``smoker``
  yes/no

``drinker``
  yes/no

``driver``
  yes/no

This will generate a simple JSON response of the following form:
