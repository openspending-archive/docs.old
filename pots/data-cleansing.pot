msgid "Most data about government finance that can be acquired needs to be cleaned up in order to be used in an application such as OpenSpending. This is even more true of data that has been extracted from sources such as PDF files, or even paper documents."

msgid "It is hard to describe exactly what needs to be done (and how): the ways in which data can be distorted or irregular are countless, and many of these errors are not obvious. The following list is therefore necessarily incomplete but it tries to provide a check list of frequent issues."

msgid "**Splitting columns:** Check that each column in your data only contains a single logical value. For example, a time column may include entries like \"December 2001 to January 2006\". This actually contains two pieces of information: a start and an end date. Try to split these columns up, for example in Google Refine."

msgid "**Fixing inconsistent spellings and values:** Get a listing of all existing values in a column. In SQL, this can be done with the DISTINCT modifier, while Google Refine offers text facets for this purpose. Looking at this list you may note inconsistencies, such as variations in spelling, casing or simply lines of data that have errors. Try to reduce the number of distinct column values as much as possible."

msgid "**Make each line represent only one measurement** A single line of source data may contain information about several years of data or about multiple transactions. For example, a budget document may contain columns like \"Year1, Year2, Year3\". You need to split this up into three rows with two new columns: \"Year\" and \"Amount\". In those cases, you should transpose the dataset across the concerned columns to generate a line for each transaction. This line should share all the remaining (common) data of the original line. Google Refine's *Transpose > Cells across columns into rows...* function on columns and the *Fill down* operation are particularly handy for this."

msgid "**Numbers and units:** For numeric columns, try to remove any currency specifications and non-decimal separators, such as commas for thousands steps (NNN,NNN.NN). All dates imported into OpenSpending must be of the form NNNN.NN, additional commas or spaces should be removed. Make sure the unit is a single number and not shortened by thousands or millions."

msgid "**Text & Encoding:** In text columns, remove any sourrounding spaces, commas and full stops. Get rid of prefixes that are common to all values of the column. When importing text with non-English characters, make sure to save your data with the UTF-8 character encoding. If umlauts or other diacritica do not show up correctly you might have to try converting the input data to UTF-8 from another encoding. OpenSpending currently does not support LTR languages and CJK text."

msgid "**ISO Dates:** OpenSpending only accepts dates in a single form, YEAR-MM-DD. You may have to convert other representations (such as spelled out month names, or other orderings of the information) into this format. An easy way to do this may be splitting the date into several columns and then merging the columns in the desired order. Take special care to distinguish between the US and conventional styles of writing dates: MM/DD/YEAR (US) vs. DD/MM/YEAR (rest of planet). Beware of the date handling methods used in Excel, it is often better to simply set date columns to be interpreted as text."

Take care to set a match score threshold that does not risk too many false positives."

msgid "There is a tension between two goals you may have in presenting the data: to show the data as-is, with little or no cleansing applied (i.e. to highlight both the content and the form in which it is  released) and to maximise the information and utility for the user."

msgid "The key quality criterion of data cleansing is how well you document what you are doing. This should include both a human readable account of the cleansing you have performed and any scripts, databases or intermediate data dumps you produce while working with the data. Don't let the fact that what you have done may be a bit murky become an excuse for not publishing such information - it is the very reason you should."
