msgid "Spending data can include various types of records, including information on government grants, commitments and actual expenditure. However, we donâ€™t expect spending data to include aggregate information. This means that while several physical payments may be consolidated into a single item, each payment from one entity to another made for a specific purpose (project, service) on a given date or during a given duration should be listed individually. Reporting data about spending that has been further aggregated will demand different modes of analysis and should instead be treated as budget data."

msgid "Budget information generally reflects the outcome (or status) of a financial programming process within government. For this purpose, data on past outcomes and appropriations for a future period are often presented jointly. Allocation is typically structured across one or many classification schemes (rather than by the actual recipients of funds). Since budget information is often based on aggregated data and statistical estimates, much of the literature on the publication of statistical information applies to it."
