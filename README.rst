Help, Documentation and Content for OpenSpending
================================================

This repository keeps content which is intended to be shown inside the OpenSpending 
platform and which is not automatically generated (i.e. not part of a dataset). We 
use Sphinx to generate static HTML pages for such content.

We're happy for any issues, pull requests and other comments on this.
