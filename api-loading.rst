Data loading API
================

Future version of OpenSpending will support and API to stage and perform
loads of datasets and to manipulate dataset and visualization metadata on
loaded datasets.

While this functionality is not yet implemented, we'd appreciate any 
input on the design of this API on our `openspending-dev <http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending-dev>`_ 
mailing list.
