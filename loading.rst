Loading Data into OpenSpending
==============================

OpenSpending is a flexible platform for storing government financial data. While we 
focus on collecting budget and transaction-level spending data, other types of 
financial reporting, such as accounts or cash flow information, can also be
represented. To accomodate such different types of information, OpenSpending does
not prescribe a specific format for the data that will be reported. Instead, we
enable users to create a custom model for their dataset. 

Overview
--------

A typical workflow for importing a dataset into OpenSpending will therefore 
involve the following steps:

* Gather machine-readable data from a trustworthy source, collecting metadata 
  such as the source, completeness and time covered in the dataset. 

* Convert the data to a denormalized CSV file in which dates and numbers will be 
  understood by OpenSpending. 

* Upload the data to the web, e.g. to `datahub.io`_. 

* Create a dataset on OpenSpending and add the address of the dataset as a new
  data source. 

* Model the dataset in OpenSpending to assign a logical role to each column in 
  the source table. This includes designating the fields in which time, 
  amount and, optionally, the spender and recipient of a transaction are 
  specified.

* Load the data or refine the data conversion based on the feedback given by the
  platform about data consistency. 

After the data has successfully loaded into OpenSpending, you can easily create 
visualizations, run searches or build custom applications on top of the APIs 
provided by the site.
