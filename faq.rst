What is OpenSpending? 
---------------------

OpenSpending is about Mapping the Money.  

The aim is to help track every (public) government and corporate financial transaction across the world and present it in useful and engaging forms for everyone from a school-child to a data geek.

What `OpenStreetMap`_ does for geography, OpenSpending does for money. OpenStreetMap has mapped the world in unprecendented levels of detail, harnessing the power of thousands of volunteers who each contribute data for their little corner of the world. However, as far as we know, there is no 'global atlas' of spending, no integrated, searchable database which would be a valuable resource for policy-makers and civil society alike. We want anyone to be able to go to their local council or national government, request the data, upload, understand and visualise it and contribute to this 'spending commons', which anyone can benefit from.

What is the relationship to Where Does My Money Go?
---------------------------------------------------

Simply put, `OpenSpending`_ is the international version of `Where Does My Money Go?`_ (WDMMG). WDMMG and used interactive 'bubble trees' to show the UK Taxpayer which spending sectors their tax money is put towards as well as having an interactive tax calculator to let users see for their level of income, how much they contribute to various spending areas through their taxes.  

**Platform vs. project**

After the success of the original project, it became clear that there was need for an international platform to allow people to build such sites at scale. Where Does My Money Go? was remodelled to become an instance of OpenSpending, the data is stored in the central OpenSpending database and a custom frontend developed using the OpenSpending API - anyone can create one just like it, with their own branding at their own URL.

How are you funded?

OpenSpending is a volunteer-run project, but it would not be able to exist without the generous support of many organisations. See `funders` for more information.
